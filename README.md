#  Readme for The Mutliomics analysis of TNBC (3 files)

1) First file to access is the Multiomics_TCGA_Analysis, in which you can download,preprocess, and analyse TCGA-TNBC multi-omics
2) Second file to access is the Survival_Analysis for TCGA-TNBC and GSE58812, in which you can evaluate the prognostic significance of immune cells and differentially abundant genes
3) Third file to access is the GSE194040_analysis, in which you can evaluate the effect of prognostic genes and immune cells on the immunotherapy response

#  Supplementary Files (9 files only)
1) TNBC_immunogenomics and Clinical.tsv are needed in the first notebook as it has clinical data for the TCGA-TNBC
2) Activated/Silenced DEMTs_3(all).csv are needed in the first notebook as they contain the miR-targets and are adapted from miRwalk
3) 2x Heterogeneity, 2x Immunotherapy scores for genomic analysis of the TCGA-TNBC
4) Cibersortx Estimated Abundances file
